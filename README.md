Gong & Ostriker (2011) developed a core finding method called GRID (GRavitatianal IDentification), which uses gravitational potential to define simulated molecular cloud cores. Mao, Ostriker, & Kim (2020) extended this algorithm to identify hierarchical structures of the interstellar medium. The first author of Mao, Ostriker, & Kim (2020) wrote a python pacakge [FISO](https://github.com/alwinm/fiso) (fast isocontours) to implement this algorithm.

This pacakge, `FHISO` (fast hierarchical isocontours), is a complete rewrite of `FISO`, aiming to enhance readability and maintainability, as well as extend its functionality.
